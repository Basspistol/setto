## Sakrecoer Uncorporated Stands for independent fun-loving Activism, Art & Music.

I am a 1980 born robot. If [Monica Zetterlund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Zetterlund){: target="_blank"} was a cyberpunk making electronic music, I would probably be Her. I aim for questions rather than answers and at pushing your creativity. I move by feet in the streets and value my integrity.

I go by many aliases that you will find if you scroll down this page.

This website was designed and executed by [me](http://set.hallstrom.ch){: target="_blank"} On these pages I push sounds, images, thoughts and passion for cool robots like you, thanks to the good [Alsenet.com](https://alsenet.com){: target="_blank"} people and the Helevtico-Russian-Swedo-Geramno-Spanglish Linux Lovers Circle.
